Analyzed the dataset using SQL to clean data, explore patterns, and generate business insights. Focused on data structure, filtering, and aggregation to support decision-making.

üìä Business Data Analysis Project: Bara Dataset

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Business Data Analysis Project using the Sales Dataset. This project is part of an academic learning experience aimed at understanding the end-to-end process of analyzing business data using SQL.

üß† Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to apply structured query language (SQL) techniques to extract meaningful patterns and actionable insights from a large, complex dataset. Through this hands-on project, we explored critical data analysis steps while developing an analytical mindset essential for solving real-world business problems.

üìö What I Learned

Throughout the project, I covered the following key concepts and skills:

- Understanding Data Structure: Identifying the types of variables (categorical, numerical) and relationships among them.
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.
- SQL Functions: Using aggregation functions, sorting, filtering, and logic-based queries to analyze datasets.
- Pattern Recognition: Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data to derive business value.
- Critical Thinking in Business Contexts: Learning to ask the right questions and interpret data in ways that inform decision-making.

üí° Key Takeaways

- SQL is a powerful tool to process and analyze real-world business datasets. 
- Understanding data before jumping into analysis is crucial.
- Small changes in query logic can significantly impact results.
- Data-driven insights can help businesses uncover opportunities, improve operations, and make informed decisions.
